            <p class="paragraph">When you first hear that the team will only be using an iPhone and CapCut, the price might sound too high. But tools don’t automatically determine the value of someone’s work — the skill of the person using them does. A professional with two years of solid experience, a strong portfolio, and good creativity can produce amazing results even with simple equipment. The iPhone 16 Pro Max already has flagship-level video quality, and editing software doesn’t matter as long as they know how to tell a story and capture the moment well.<br><br><b>So would I agree to the 40k deal?</b><br>
Yes, if their portfolio clearly shows they can deliver work that feels worth the price.
You’re not just paying for the device they hold — you’re paying for their consistency, timing, editing sense, effort, and the pressure of documenting one of the most important days of your life. If they can guarantee quality and reliability, the gear becomes secondary.<br><br>This connects to how we view “vibe coders” and people who rely heavily on AI tools in development. Some developers use AI the way the documentation team uses CapCut: as a tool to speed things up. But without actual skill, understanding, and creativity, the output falls apart. Tools don’t magically make someone good. A vibe coder who only depends on AI without real knowledge often produces shallow or unstable work. Integrity comes from knowing your craft and using tools responsibly — not letting tools carry all the weight.<br><br>In both cases, what matters is the person behind the tool. A skilled creator can make great output with limited equipment. Someone with no foundational skills will struggle even with the most advanced AI. Tools assist creativity; they don’t replace it.</p>
