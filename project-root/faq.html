            <p class="paragraph"><b>1. What is Generative AI?</b></p>
            <div class="paragraph1">
                <p>Generative AI is a type of technology that can create things — such as text, images, music, videos, and even code — based on patterns it learned from huge amounts of data. Instead of just giving information, it can produce new content that didn’t exist before.<p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph"><b>2. How does Generative AI work?</b></p>
            <div class="paragraph1">
                <p>It works by studying massive amounts of examples and learning how language, images, or sounds generally look or behave. Once it understands these patterns, it can generate its own versions.
Think of it like someone learning by reading thousands of books — eventually, they’ll be able to write in a similar style.</p>

            <p class="paragraph"><b>6. Additional FAQs</b></p>
            <div class="paragraph1">
                <p><b>☢ Is GenAI meant to replace humans? ☢</b></p>
                <p>No. It’s meant to assist people, not replace skills, creativity, or decision-making. Humans are still responsible for accuracy, ethics, and final judgment.</p>

                <p><b>☢ Should I rely on AI for everything? ☢</b></p>
                <p>No. AI is a tool — not a teacher, expert, or authority. It’s great for ideas and drafts, but humans still need to verify, edit, and think critically.</p>
